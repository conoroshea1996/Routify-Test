  Even with all of the technology intended to help narrow job candidates down to
  only the top choices, interviewing is still a key part of the process.
  While [artificial
  intelligence](https://www.forbes.com/sites/falonfatemi/2019/10/31/how-ai-is-uprooting-recruiting/?sh=3dee9c4046ce) can
  reduce the time a recruiter or hiring manager spends on the process, it
  doesn’t replace the real-life assessment present in interviews. Asking your
  finalists the top interview questions will always be the best way to determine
  if they’ll be a good long-term fit for the job and your company.


  Though work from home jobs are on the rise, [remote hiring](https://hirehive.com/remote-hiring-trends-2021-future-of-recruiting/) also requires a determination of the candidate’s fit with the company culture as well as aspects of what it means to self-manage and work independently and on a remote team.


  What are the top 10 job interview questions to ask candidates as you make your hiring decisions this year?![top 10 interview questions for recruiters](https://hirehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/top-10-interview-questions-for-recruiters-400x400.png)


  ## Top 10 Interview Questions of 2021


  With all of the changes in the marketplace over 2020, [there are some tried-and-true questions](https://www.diverse-employment.co.uk/interview-questions) as well as new ideas that you’ll need to convey in an interview. These questions may be about their experience, aptitude, productivity, diversity, and exposure to remote work. Here are the top 10 interview questions that will help you make smart hiring decisions in 2021.




  ### 1. Tell Me About a Time When


  This is less a specific question and more of a type of question you should always be asking in interviews. It’s a category known as [behavioral interviewing](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/behavioral-job-interview-questions-2059620). They’re designed to encourage the candidate to think on their feet and give you an example of an experience they’ve had on the job.


  For example, you can ask “Tell me about a time when you didn’t get along with your coworkers. How did you handle that?” Or, “Tell me about a time when a project didn’t go according to plan. How did you get back on track?”


   


  ### 2. Why Do You Want to Work Here?


  You’re not looking for a body in a chair. You’re looking for a skilled professional interested in working with your business specifically. So put the onus on them to communicate their interest level to you. There’s no right answer, but you will see how much work they’ve done ahead of their interview.


  What you’re looking for here how well they understand what you do and, potentially, your work culture. You want to see how they convey that your company is the right company for this stage of their career.


   


  ### 3. Why Did You Leave Your Last Position?


  Or, if they’re still working, “[Why are you looking to leave your current position](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/answering-why-you-left-your-last-job)?” Their answer will give you a lot of background information that could help you decide if they’ll be a good fit for your organization.


  For instance, if they communicate a negative reason such as an uncooperative boss, you may have questions about their ability to work well as a part of your team. Instead, look for candidates to provide positive reasons rather than negative ideas.


   


  ### 4. What Motivates You?


  Every person has a different set of motivators. Nothing is specific right or wrong, but some may be more compatible with your specific office environment. It’s important to understand what drives a potential candidate to see if they match your company’s values.


  Someone who is motivated by creativity, innovation, and problem-solving may not thrive in a traditionally professional environment where the following procedure is the primary motivating factor.
